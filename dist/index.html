                    <p class="p2">NFT Flipper is NFT matchmaking gambling dApp built at ETHBelgrade2023 hackathon. It delivers an innovative solution to the problem of fragmented NFT utility and limited gameplay opportunities by providing a platform that combines staking, randomness, and winner-takes-all mechanics. Users stake their NFTs in matches, and the smart contract autonomously selects a random winner. The winner takes possession of all the staked NFTs, creating an exciting element of risk.</p>
