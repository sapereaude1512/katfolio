The software, implemented on a Raspberry Pi, facilitates the seamless operation of the machine. I have developed the HMI design, which not only enhances the user experience but also facilitates the continuous improvement of the software and overall capabilities. The intuitive interface enables users to easily select and adjust cutting configurations to match specific requirements. This project aims to enhance food preparation efficiency while maintaining high levels of accuracy and consistency.'
